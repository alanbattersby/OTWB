Ornamental turners workbench

This project is aimed a creating a simulation of a rose engine see http://www.otinexperiences.co.uk/blog
The tool paths created can be used to generate a gcode program to control a cnc system.
The program is .net based and written in c#.

The code is in the form of a Windows 8 App and is being developed on Visual Studio Express for Windows 8. 
So if you download you will need to get a developer License to compile on your system.

The code is very much pre Alpha, simple Gcode generation has been implemented as have many other parts.

Current Functionality  

There are 6 types of patterns currently available

1. Display of patterns described in Bazely' s book.
2. Display of patterns described by Ross.
3. Display of patterns described by Wheels in Wheels
4. Display of patterns generated by several simple Rosettes.
5. Display Lattices designed as a replicated cell arranged either
	1. Around the edge 
	2. Across the face 
of a bowl

The program can Generate simple gcode as either

* All paths plus main code in one file
* Each path in an individual file with main code in an individual file
* Use absolute or relative positioning for points
* Generate for standard XY movement or for rotary table
* Main code parts implemented as a series of user editable templates
*Uses a general binding model within templates

Please note that gode generation for lattices and braids is not implemented.
