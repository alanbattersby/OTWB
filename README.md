Ornamental turners workbench

This project is aimed a creating a simulation of a rose engine see http://www.otinexperiences.co.uk/blog
The tool paths created can be used to generate a gcode program to control a cnc system.
The program is .net based and written in c#.

The code is in the form of a Windows 8 App and is being developed on Visual Studio Express for Windows 8. 
So if you download you will need to get a developer License to compile on your system.

The code is very much pre Alpha, simple Gcode generation has been implemented as have many other parts.

Current Functionality  

There are 4 types of patterns currently available

1) Display of patterns described in Bazely' s book.
2) Display of patterns described by Ross.
3) Display of patterns described by Wheels in Wheels
4) Display of patterns generated by several simple Rosettes.
5) Generate simple gcode as either
    a) All paths plus main code in one file
    b) Each path in an individual file with main code in an individual file
    c) Use absolute or relative positioning for points
    d) Generate for standard XY movement or for rotary table
    e) Main code parts implemented as a series of user editable templates
    f) Uses a general binding model within templates
