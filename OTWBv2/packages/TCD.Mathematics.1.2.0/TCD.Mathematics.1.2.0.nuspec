    <description>NOTE: since v1.2.0 it's a Portable Class Library. Due to the nature of Portable Class Libraries, it's not possible to maintain the System.Windows.Media.Media3D namespace (and extending it). Instead all classes now orignate from TCD.Mathematics

TCD.Mathematics provides classrs, which allow advanced calculations with points, vectors, lines and planes.

The new classes:
Vector3D
Point3D
Line3D
Plane3D

The Point3D extension methods:
Vector3D.AsPoint3D()
Point3D.AsVector3D()

If you find any bugs, or miss a method, please let me know!</description>
